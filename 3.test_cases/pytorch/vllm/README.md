# vLLM test cases

[vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) is a high-throughput,
OpenAI-API-compatible LLM serving engine. The samples in this directory
deploy vLLM on AWS for inference workloads, with options for high-
performance EFA networking, expert-parallel all-to-all
([UCCL-EP](https://github.com/uccl-project/uccl)), and disaggregated
prefill/decode KV-cache transfer
([NIXL](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/nixl)).

## Available test cases

| Test case | Orchestrator | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`dsv3-uccl-nixl`](./dsv3-uccl-nixl) | EKS / HyperPod EKS | DeepSeek-V3 disaggregated inference (1P+ND) on `p5en.48xlarge` with vLLM 0.21.0, UCCL-EP, and NIXL over EFA. |
